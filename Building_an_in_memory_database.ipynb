        "Your task is to implement a simplified version of an in-memory database. Plan your design according to the level specifications below:\n",
        "\n",
        "Level 1: In-memory database should support basic operations to manipulate records, fields, and values within fields.\n",
        "Level 2: In-memory database should support retrieving statistics about the frequency of updates to records.\n",
        "Level 3: In-memory database should support multiple users and allow users to lock records.\n",
        "Level 4: In-memory database should support undo and logout operations from users.\n",
        "To move to the next level, you need to pass all the tests at this level.\n",
        "\n",
        "Level 3\n",
        "Introduce operations to support users locking access to records.\n",
        "\n",
        "Users can request to temporarily lock a particular record, acquiring exclusive modification access.\n",
        "If a record is already locked by another user, locking requests are put in a first-in-first-out queue.\n",
        "Repeated locking requests for a record from the same user should be ignored.\n",
        "Each modification operation from the previous levels now has an alternative version with a caller_id parameter, which represents a unique string identifier associated with a user. These operations should function the same way as the original version if the user with the given caller_id has locked the record and thus is eligible to modify the record; otherwise, the operation will not change the database. The prior versions should not modify locked records due to the lack of a caller_id to establish permissions. When a user waits for modification access to a locked record, any modification operations they execute on the record are ignored (instead of delayed).\n",
        "\n",
