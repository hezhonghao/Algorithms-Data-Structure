        "The main concept of monte carlo tree search is a search. Search is a set of traversals down the game tree. Single traversal is a path from a root node (current game state) to a node that is not fully expanded. Node being not-fully expanded means at least one of its children is unvisited, not explored. Once not fully expanded node is encountered, one of its unvisited children is chosen to become a root node for a single playout/simulation. The result of the simulation is then propagated back up to the current tree root updating game tree nodes statistics. Once the search (constrained by time or computational power) terminates, the move is chosen based on the gathered statistics.\n",
