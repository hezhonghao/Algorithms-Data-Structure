        "## What is it for?\n",
        "- To create a tree structure search algorithm that balances depth and breadth (exploitation and exploration)\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## How it works?\n",
        "- When traveling to each node & staying at certain board state, you simulate the expected returns if traveling a given path to the end, and return rewards to each node at that path.\n",
        "- You should probably estimate current resources, too.\n",
        "- The resources and rewards may or may not be the same thing. Likely you may gain resources as rewards, but very likely they are different things.\n",
        "- Return: MCTS is like an assistant. It takes in current board state and returns you a recommendation for the next move, according to many times of simulations (Not as you thought that it would give you a whole path).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Selection:\n",
        "\n",
        "### Expansion:\n",
        "The action of exploring untried moves and adding them to your list of children. Untried moves are those empty positions on the board.\n",
        "\n",
        "*For MCTS, you always expand first untile there is no node to be added to your children and then you select best one as the next move. So expand --> select.\n",
        "\n",
        "*expansion VS selection: two different moves, connecting new nodes VS selecting your best child;\n",
        "*exploration VS exploitation: two different strategies, exploring new nodes VS go down the current path.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Simulation:\n",
        "For a chosen node, you traverse all the way till the end to reap all the rewards along the way.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is one round of simulation? Does it do the same as one run of MCTS?\n",
        "No.\n",
        "- One round of simulation starts with a actual board state to a simulated board state where you receive an end state (no further move can be made)\n",
        "- In such a simulation, each node in the current copy of board, will connect parent and children, will go down a particular path (simulation step)\n",
        "- For each iteration of MCTS (a copy board state):\n",
        "  - selection: you select the best child node for current parent, if the current node is fully expanded and it's not terminal, yet.\n",
        "  - expansion you expand a new node as long as there is still child to be added.\n",
        "  - simulation: you start with the newly expanded node and simulate current path to the end as long as (while) there is untried nove left and no winner declared\n",
        "  - backpropagation: you return the stats of this simulation to the nodes traversed in this simulation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Key things to be differentiated between selection, expansion, and simulation:\n",
        "- Selection is to exploit and expansion to explore.\n",
        "- Expansion connects one new node a time, and simulation continues that new node to the end of this path.\n",
        "- Selection also down the path of selected node, but with each move calculated whereas simulation does things randomly. You'd hope this randomization to give you a bit signal (by BP) that you can used for future moves.\n",
        "- Simulation is about exploitation whereas selection is about a balance between exploration and exploitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Backpropagation:\n",
        "return the stats (steps/resources + rewards) to parent nodes such that at parent nodes they may decide an optimal next move (for selection). It was part of, however the opposite route of the simulation. Simulation goes down the rabbithole, and GP goes out of it and back.\n",

        "\n",
        "### Overall MCTS workflow\n",
        "- I had some fundamental misunderstanding of its workflow originally:\n",
        "  - I thougt it was a class. It probably does not work that way because a class is for algorithms + data structure where you store something. But a MCTS is just an algorithm, a stragegy for your game. It does not hold data like you would need for a board or a node.\n",
        "  - I thought you'd define 4 functions for 4 steps. It was not wrong, but just not necessary. It's perfectly fine without them.\n",
        "  - I could not differentiate MCTS workflow from what's in node/board. What's about the rules and data structure of the game should be in either node or board, whereas MCTS is about the strategy.\n",
        "  - I did not realize with a MCTS you input current board state and outut a recommended move. In retrospect, this is actually most intuitive.\n",
        "  - I did not know that you create copies of board states on which you would run 4 steps (not only simulation!).\n",
        "  - I did not know that any changes on references (associated to each iteration/copy of board state) to the root nodes (what you are assigned when starting the MCTS) will also apply to the root nodes. Like the stats (wins/visits), and children nodes connected to.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Tips for connecting diff class/functions together\n",
        "  -\n",
        "\n",
        "## Board and Node\n",
        "- Node: Each node is a TreeNode, where you have attributes and methods can be applied to each node. Please be reminded that everything you'd apply to a node, like a list, is independent from a different node.\n",
        "- Board: where you set up result, board state,\n",
        "- The tricky part for this game is though, you have to get a copy of _current board state_ for each simulation, the real deep copy that does not affect one another.\n",
        "- Connections between Node and Board: When you make a move, your node changes (you select next move based on UCB1) and your board changes, too (the current board state).\n",
        "- Mind that SELECT and EXPAND are very different operations. SELECT makes next move, where EXPAND adds a potential child to current parent thereafter you may do simulation with.\n",
        "- UCB1: an algorithm, or actually just one sorting funciton that to balence exploration and exploitation. Two terms: exploitation term that to calculate wins/visits of current path; and exploration term that to encourage exploring different paths where you've visited less and are less certain about their wins/visits.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is really a board? Is that a static board state, as you've regarded as, or a dynamic one?\n",
        "If a dynamic one, where to draw the boundary (what is a board, in contrast to other boards?)\n",
        "- I think a board should represent a static board state, with moves actually made, not simulated.\n",
        "- In contrast, a copy represents a board state that starts with the actual one, but has speculated moves on there.\n",
        "- so when you define a board state, you have # of nodes defined, each represent a actual moved position on there.\n",
        "\n",
        "What is really a node if it does not represent a move (bc MCTS returns a move)\n",
        "- I think a node represent a position, travelled or untravelled (but extended, and then simulated), belongs to a give board state. <br>\n",
        "- The above understanding is not complete. I think you had this conception that a node is a defined position on the board state. This is only true when you define a node with `node = Node(idx = idx)`. But a node can work perfect fine if `idx=None`. So a more nuanced understanding of a node is it's a position on current board state but it's idx can be unknown. A node would be just a node structure that you can have all its nice attributes and methods. In this TTT example, you may connect a node to its parent & children (both speak for its relative positions), you give it an idx, a board state with `(0,1;x,o)` all indictaed. However, any of them can be set as `None`.\n",
        "  - So yes it should be good to have idx of a node, but it's fine if not. And its idx can be either user-identified, or randomly choosen in `EXPAND`. <br>\n",
        "\n",
        "What is a fully expanded node?\n",
        "- a fully expanded node means all untravelled nodes are added to it as children nodes and there is no need to further expand. We can now explore/select best node out of all children\n",
        "\n",
        "Is a node configurated differently in different copies and different board states?\n",
        "- visit & win counts are accumulated through many rounds if simulations.\n",
        "- for this reason (visit & win counts), I think node is defined independent from board states/copy states. There should be 9 nodes defined, period.\n",
        "- However, in different simulations (and by extension, different copies), node may be modified by which parent/children they are connected, too.\n",
        "- In a pre-defined/user-defined board state, node positions are defined, but node connections are not. They are just on board states and you do not know how do they reach that state.\n",
        "- When you start a new copy of current board state, self.children, a.k.a node connection configuration, should be empty.\n",
        "\n",
        "## TreeNode data structure\n",
        "- just like link\n",
        "\n",
        "## Game/RL\n",
        "- Design of reward function: yes it should be updated back to every single node, but the calculation is at the final result, which is why it's called \"backpropogation\". I am writting this because I misunderstood reward function in TTT game is reward = 1 2 3 when you get 1 2 3 in a line. It does not work that way. It should be calculated when you get a 3 in simulation, and then you make the way back to the nodes.\n",
        "- WHen do you need a reward function?\n",
        "  - When the steps are more than 2 (otherwise you do move?), and the space for exploration is large and you will need to make simulation and allocate your rewards to those winning strategies in the simulation.\n",
        "- Policy: I think it's wrong to have a policy up here. Beacuse Node is to deal with attributes and actions on node. I know you wanted it to move \"according to certain policy\", but it actually just basic \"move\". Your intended policy should go with MCTS.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Why it may work better or worse than other methods in diff areas?\n",
        "- MCTS should work better in scenarios where you cannot traverse all pathes (potentially your space of moves is enormously large and even infinite). Here MCTS's random search may guide the decisions between exploration and exploitation.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Where things may get tricky?\n",
        "- It seems MCTS is computationally demanding\n",

        "The main concept of monte carlo tree search is a search. Search is a set of traversals down the game tree. Single traversal is a path from a root node (current game state) to a node that is not fully expanded. Node being not-fully expanded means at least one of its children is unvisited, not explored. Once not fully expanded node is encountered, one of its unvisited children is chosen to become a root node for a single playout/simulation. The result of the simulation is then propagated back up to the current tree root updating game tree nodes statistics. Once the search (constrained by time or computational power) terminates, the move is chosen based on the gathered statistics.\n",
